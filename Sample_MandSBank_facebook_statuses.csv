Also have wasted ages twice now trying to fill in form online and it lets you type for ages only to refuse to send ""with a fault "" at the end. Ridiculous and as my policy is due for renewal i am awaiting an HONEST response about why this has happened to so many people. £72.10 taken twice yesterday was thankfully spotted before more damage was done so i am unwilling to chance the new policy amount of £81.  a month if you are likely to do the same again.

457376154351363_954038818018425,"I recently applied for a £10000 loan from M&S Bank which had a very good interest rate advertised. I was surprised to get knocked back for the loan since I have never had any issues with credit before and the repayments were well within my budget. I called your customer services to find out why I was knocked back and I was told it was because of my credit rating, as determined by Experian.

So I signed up to Experian yesterday to find out what my credit score is, and here is what I don't understand....

Low and behold, Experian have given me a rating of 979 out of 999 and they call this an 'Excellent' credit rating.

There is no higher classification.

So how exactly did my credit rating result in M&S knocking back my application? How high a credit rating do I need to have before I qualify for an M&S loan? 999 out of 999?",2015-12-30 13:38:04

The first time, I attempted to buy using my debit card and was informed I must have photo ID; this was my fault for not being prepared.  The second visit, on Tuesday of this week, I brought along my passport only to be told it couldn't be accepted because it expired last August.  Amazing! I can use an expired passport two years after its expiration date to fly domestically within the UK, but not to buy foreign currency from M&S.  During my second attempt, your bureau assistant did inform me that he could sell me the currency (Canadian Dollars) as a cash transaction without ID, which leads me onto my final attempt, this afternoon.

I emailed about this two nights ago and was assured that I would receive a reply within 48 hours and have not.

The overall bill was over £534, but as I did not remember exact amount, I paid £530 off, on time, leaving about £4 unpaid. To my surprise, an interest of £13.91 was added on my latest statment! When I rang customer services, it was explained to me that interest is charged on the full amount on last statement (£534 in my case), not the actual amount owed! Reading through Citizen's Advise Bereau, your own Terms and Conditions online, I cannot see how this is even possible and justifiable!
Even though I have been advised that M&S will discretionally refund me the £13.91 this one time as ""a gesture of good will"", as I always pay in full and on time, I am very disappointed that M&S is even trying to charge people amounts that would not be deemed reasonable in English Court of Law and expect customers to ""spot"" charges like this and chase refunds. Very disappointing! Certainly, the refund is far from a gesture a good will, rather a basic decency to rectify a major error!

I rang my local post office today and asked them if I could pay a cheque into my M&S account there, as they accepted payments into HSBC.  The lady told me that the deposit envelopes had M&S Bank printed on them, so it would seem that Icould. However, when the post office assistant entered my details on the computer it would not accept them, so he had to ring you. Seemingly he was told than one cannot pay into M&S bank accounts via the post office.  He then told whoever he was talking to that this was confusing because M&S bank is printed onto the envelope, and I agree with him.  As I said, it was no big deal for me, but some people may have had to get a taxi to the post office, asked a third party to do it for them, or really struggled to walk there, only to be told this service is not available.

I was advised to post it here once someone kindly told me what to look under.  After receiving a special offer of 20 months interest free on balance transfers from M&S Banking, I transferred balances from two of my other store/credit cards. I asked the Customer service advisor about the Direct Debit I had set up previously with them and was assured that it was in place. I asked that a specific amount be paid every month and, as far as I was concerned, that was that in place. I then received a letter stating I had defaulted (and was charged) as the bank had refused the request for payment. I contacted my bank and they told me that no request had been even made and they would send me proof of this. I called M&S again, all to my cost, and they apologies and stated that the previous DD had been cancelled because I had not used for a while (something the Customer Service Advisor should have noticed)!!! I paid the amount owed by my Debit card and set up a new Direct Debit. I was told the date of when the first payment would be coming out of my Bank Account (28th August) and to pay anything owed until then with another method (which I did). Well, surprise, the money did NOT come out of my bank account on the date and I had to call Customer Services AGAIN. All to my cost (it is not a free phone service). This time, I asked for a Manager. She told me that, according to my file, the Direct Debit had been CANCELLED!!! I asked who had cancelled a DD that had only been set up on that day, a question they could not answer
 . Once again, I had been charged a default charge, and I spent a good while trying to explain that I had set up the DD for a specific amount and not the minimum amount. Once again, I set up ANOTHER Direct Debit and was, once again, assured that it was in place and that the default charges would be taken off my account. I hope that there is no impact on my Credit rating or that M&S do not try and default me because of their continuous mistakes.

(Which I know I was going to be accepted for..... which I have been) but 23 days after my application and I still haven't got my card. I haven't even received the contract to sign yet. So I'm still at least a week away from getting my card. At this pace... prob another month. Absolutely disgusting service. When I applied I was told I would have my decision in 3 to 5 working days! (In another part of the site it says normally within the 1st 48 hours... but can take 3-5 working days.) I had to send a proof of address, understandably this will prolong it slightly..... SLIGHTLY!!!! I worked for carphone warehouse, doing credit agreements and contracts all the time. I have a very good understanding of how a credit check is carried out, and how long it can take. This is taking the piss. The only explanation I have got from an advisor is that you are experiencing a high volume of applications. You are advertising as a bank!! If u can't handle the work load, hire more people, or else reflect this in the time scales u promise people throughout their application. Most other companies take an hour for a decision, card within a week. And I have no choice but to suffer this excruciating wait for a simple service.... Because I have been accepted and u have done a credit check on my name. So I can't go apply for another company and make my own credit look bad having multiple credit applications. Hence why I knew I'd be accepted... I know how to look after my credit score. I put in a complaint. To have no response. Except for 2 emails saying you are looking into it..... but no further update. Another example of your wonderful customer service. Individually the advisors I have spoken with are very polite and lovely to speak to. And I have no complaint against any individual. But the speed of the service is ridiculous. Start as you mean to go on....

I contacted M&S on 16th June to report my card as stolen.  The details were took and I was told I would receive a replacement card and PIN.  On 2nd July I contacted the customer number and reported that only the PIN had been received.  I spent 40 minutes trying to explain the situation to a member of staff who did not speak very good English and we both found difficulty in understanding one another.  I was told that the card will be requested again.

On 7th July I went to the M&S store in Newtownabbey and explained the situation to the staff.  They then contacted the same department I did, with the in store call system.  The staff were told again the card would be reissued and that was all that could be done.

I contacted M&S again on the phone, to no resolve and waiting further on the card arriving.

On the 18th July, I received a 2nd PIN and 3 individual new store cards.  In order to find out which PIN corresponded to which card, I had to again drive to the M&S store as the staff on the customer service line were of no help.  I explained my situation again to the in store staff, who again made calls to different departments, to find someone who could help.  

We eventually made a purchase and used a PIN number to test which card belonged to what, as we had no other way of knowing.  

Cancelling and replacing a stolen card should not create this much stress and hassle.  M&S customer service was nonexistent on the customer number I was recommended to assist me.  The staff in store did what they could but with a very limited system in place.

Quite literally the worst online banking experience I have had. Can never get access, site is always down, can't see transactions, statements etc to be able to manage my account.
Topping it all is the fact that I have received no feedback or contact after e-mailing M&S Bank to complain about this very very poor service.
Call it customer service, I think not!

they actually mean they offer you a rate loosely based on the going rate of which we accepted, again you have no proof by this time.

457376154351363_841237452631896,"M&S Insurance left me uninsured!

PLEASE READ THIS AND TAKE NOTICE.

I bought a new car and obtained cover for it at the end of April. My existing policy was due to be renewed at the beginning of May and I paid a small fee to cover me until the policy would be renewed. My policy had been automatically renewed on it's anniversary each year.

On the 14th May to my horror I received a letter sent by 2nd Class mail (dated 11th May 2015) telling me that my policy had expired the previous day (10th May) and that I was uninsured! I had of course been driving the car continuously since getting new cover.

It beggars belief that when all communications were done by telephone and email that the most important letter you could ever send telling me that I was uninsured was sent by ordinary mail, and 2nd Class at that!!!!

I telephoned immediately on receipt of the letter and spoke to a very helpful operator who said that if the policy had not been automatically renewed then it could only be at my request that this had been done. I told her that this was definitely not the case. I had not been asked when getting the new cover whether or not I still wanted an automatic renewal. I was then told that it could have been because my debit card details were showing that my card had expired in March 2015. I said that when getting the new policy I was told how much I would have to pay until renewal. Nothing was said about how payment would be made and I assumed that It would be taken by DD in the normal way. I was not told that my card details were not valid. 

To add insult to injury the letter says ""we would point out that it is an offence to use or permit the use of a motor vehicle on a public highway or a road to which the public have access, without the minimum of insurance cover"".

Thanks M&S insurance if I had had an accident in which someone was severely injured or killed I would be paying compensation for the rest of my life and probably be bankrupt. if I had been stopped by the Police I would have had no defence to  driving without a valid policy of insurance.

Will I be renewing with M&S insurance again.......

I only renewed in a panic as I was just about to use the car!!!",2015-05-16 12:08:02

*With the M&S Monthly Saver you can save from as little as £25 up to a maximum of £250 a month. Which means that, if you pay in the maximum monthly contribution of £250 on the same date each month, for 12 months, you could earn gross interest of around £96. Partial withdrawals not permitted. Interest is paid at the end of the 12 month term. If you save less than £250 in any given month, you can carry over any unused allowance to the following months. Monthly Saver interest is calculated daily and credited annually at the end of the 12 month term.

I was also advised that I had to pay a £50 charge! I called 'M&S car insurance' and was advised that even though I have a record of emailing M&S car insurance, they cannot verify what I sent them, so there is no evidence that the email I sent included evidence of No Claims Discount! I have the email I sent plus an email back from M&S saying thanking for sending us an email... And it was sent to the correct email address! After a 35 minute phone call, they have now restarted my insurance and kept stressing they were waiving the £50 cancellation fee - but it was their error not mine, you were not doing me a favour. Note, I had been with M&S for 4 years but their renewal quote was 50 % higher than starting a new policy from scratch! They even had proof of my no claims on the system when I called up as I had previously been with them. The major point, in addition to stress and worry, was I HAD BEEN DRIVING WITH NO CAR INSURANCE FOR THREE DAYS AND DIDN'T KNOW! THAT IS ILLEGAL! All I got was, you didn't have an accident, the point is, it is illegal to drive without insurance and I had purchased a policy and was unaware you cancelled it - thanks for letting me know three days later by post! Main M&S head office said they cannot comment on money products as it is not their service. I said 'but it says M&S car insurance' but they advised me that it is 3rd party so technically nothing to do with them - so why can I purchase M&S car insurance from M&S website? I understand it is 3rd party, but surely you must have some responsibility. Human error can occur but I do not appreciate being questioned in a very rude manner on my email with NCD (even though I said I could forward both emails), how I was made to illegally drive for 3 days without insurance (note, I was advised that because I purchased insurance via your internet, it meant all communications are by post - so why did I have to supply my phone contact details?); that the product was not technically an M&S product and that no one sees what happened as a problem!

*UPDATE* M&S have now changed the way in which their system accepts certain words in order to accommodate the below.

M&S BAN THE USE OF 'CHRIST' AND 'JESUS CHRIST' in online messages for flower orders, but the use of the words Jihad, Allah, Buddah and d*** is still allowed. The supermarket giant says it has a policy in place to remove certain words in order to stop them being misused, but some people have cried outrage as it prevents them from sending Christian prayers and wishes to friends, loved ones and even on funeral and sympathy gifts.

What do you make of the ban? Is it unfair that the deity of one religious sect can be mentioned, but not another? Do you agree that the firm should take steps to prevent the mis-use of Christ's name?

Sarah Dodds Yes Matt hi. I have already raised a complaint but am left a bit frustrated to be honest. I applied for a credit card on the 17th of January to take advantage of the 0% on purchases as I have had to make a rather large purchase. They wrote to me to let me know they couldn't complete my request until they had received the signed credit agreement from me. I had already sent this...and to confirm this they had actually enclosed the original signed copy in the envelope! This delayed the process by some 10 days...meaning I needed to make the purchase on my existing lloyds credit card. I called customer services and asked if they could waive or refund the balance transfer fee if I moved the balance to the card once I received it.... They said they couldn't. The fee isn't the smallest on the market however it would have only been about £50. They did however give me 1500 loyalty points to use in their store ! All I really wanted Matt was for the fee to be waived or refunded as it was not my error that has caused this expense. 
I received my card finally yesterday...

457376154351363_758847017537607,"*************PLEASE READ***********

I am being held to ransom by marks and Spencer's car insurance. 
After the promise in two separate phone calls that someone would get back to me.......they haven't. I'm not prepared to spend my valuable time chasing people who blatantly lie. Even if they have made no progress, a short call to say the matter is still ongoing but they're working on it would be courteous surely. 

My (stationary) vehicle was badly assaulted by a (somewhat larger) vehicle some months earlier in the year. The third party admitted liability, my excess was reimbursed and my vehicle was ""repaired"" (I'll get on to that bit).
So why, months later, when my renewal quote comes through (alarmingly higher than the current year - despite paying to protect my ncb) am I then told that the claim is unresolved and so I am still listed as at fault?!?!?!
Why was none of this mentioned 2 weeks ago when  I called to change vehicle details? So right now, my renewal is due very early next year. All the competitor quotes I have received, I have applied for fraudulently (though not knowingly) as I have disclosed a no fault claim. If I choose to insure with a competitor, I have to pay more and wait for M&S to sort this out, then get confirmation of the non fault, send it to my new insurer and wait for reimbursement of the difference which is difficult and frustrating. If I remain with M&S, I have to do the same but it just eliminates any further parties getting involved. And since the original claim involved 6 different agencies/companies and the ability to communicate between those was shocking, it's probably best to stay put for now hence being held to ransom. I bet if it got sorted shortly after my policy was renewed, you'd insist on charging a heavy cancellation fee since I have no intention of staying with any longer than I really need to. 

Anyway, the original claim when my vehicle was ""repaired"". You insist on using your ""approved repairers"". Well not only did they have to order a part 5 times to get the right one but the repairs they have done are substandard to the point my car was devalued by approximately £700 because of this. Now, I'm no mechanic and when I collected my car it all looked shiny and new and fixed. Seemingly this was not the case but I only found this out when I came to part exchange it and it was looked at closely professional car people. As I believed the claim was fully settled and completed, I went ahead with the part exchange and accepted the loss as I didn't think it was something I could claim for as the claim was settled. Had I known the claim was still unresolved, I'd have contacted you and insisted the repairs were rectified by MY approved and trusted repairer. 
Now I am out of pocket by approximately £700 due to the loss in part exchanging my vehicle and will be out of pocket further due to an almost doubled insurance quote. 
So marks and Spencer's, I eagerly await a satisfactory response in how you intend to move forward with this. Any further, cheaper quote which still considers the claim a fault claim is not satisfactory. 
Please include contact details for the insurance ombudsman in your reply.",2014-12-19 10:52:36

I noted that my premiums had increased by almost 50% in the two years since I first took out the policy.  The cats are a 5 year old male and 6 years old female, both moggies and both indoor cats.  There have been no claims.

I called to query this, and was given a very poor reason... cats getting older.  I asked if the premium could be reviewed as was advised that as I was outside the renewal date, no movement was available.  I was told that a discount could have been given if I had contacted during the renewal period... something which by the way is not indicated anywhere in the renewal documents.

Quite frankly I'm amazed particularly from a brand like M&S.  Obtaining a quote online today shows a much cheaper offer but I guess this is 'new customer only' territory.

I am hoping a post of social media will get a more favourable response.  Otherwise in 24 hours I will be cancelling my policy and moving my business elsewhere.

Frank Mathews Ok still NOT happy with M&S Home insurance, I have spoken with them and they tell me my house is in a flood zone and therefore my premium has gone up, they can't quote with another company because they won't insure us, our house/cottage is 200 years old and has NEVER flooded, we have never had a claim of ANY description, I have also sent a ENVIRONMENT AGENCY Flood map of my house to M&S showing we are on a very LOW RISK area to be ever flooded from River or Sea , so what's the reason ? I have not heard back since I have sent proof we are a low/no risk of Flood ??

Spoke to them a very nice lady called Lucy, however after 57 minutes of a recorded conversation I find that it is based on post code not your property ?????, this I understand if it is an area known for burglary so your contents premium is high because everyone is a high risk, but their researchers who have probably never been to my area let alone my house to know the risk of flood is low, so that now means we are tarred with the same brush as those living in the very low (above sea level) area of our post code and next to the main river, that I presume even means upstairs flats lol, now AXA are one of the companies (ours in this case) which underwrite for M&S, as a good and loyal customer of M&S not just for our home buildings and contents insurance but also Motor insurance, and shop almost exclusively there for just about everything, I now feel let down by them, I am angry that we have paid far more in the past than others have quoted because we trust the M&S name to provide a good and trustworthy product, what right have you (AXA) Got to say OUR HOUSE is at risk of flood when it has never flooded in 200 years and The Environment agency also have OUR HOUSE in a low/no risk area, the response to that was we don't use Environment Agency information just post codes  this hasn't finished

457376154351363_710650352357274,"I must say that the service provided by M&S Insurance has to be the worst service I have ever recieved. I am sure that the Social Media department within M&S will be all over this and get it deleted as soon as it is posted, but I will continue to post this daily until my issue is rectified. 

I insure my car through my parents address as I move around the country alot for work. I havent been at my parents house for a number of weeks and have not picked up any post. I have just been told that my insurance policy has been cancelled, and had been for 3 weeks ago because when I set up my policy, M&S failed to set up the direct debit from my bank account. At NO POINT did anybody call me to tell me, and at NO POINT did anybody call me to say my policy was being cancelled, and at NO POINT did anyone call to say that I was driving uninsured. They did however, get straight on the phone when they wanted me to pay an outstanding balance! 

Surely you have a duty of care to every motorist in the UK to make sure that if one of your policies is being cancelled, you get in touch on the numerous numbers I have provided, or one of the 2 email addresses I provided to let me know that my policy was being cancelled? Through no fault of my own, I will now be charged more for any future insurance because M&S only pick up the phone to rectify an issue when they want to take a payment!!

If I would have crashed my car and injured myself or others, I would have been prosecuted for being an uninsured driver, even though I was completely unaware that I was! 

I would also like to point out that when I called your customer services department to sort out this issue, I was faced by a lady who spent 15 minutes hiding behind company policy, and wouldnt even offer any kind of solution. Why do your staff have no power to help a customer, and instead just hide behind M&S' procedures. 

This is by far the worst service I have ever received from any company I have dealt with, and still, nobody will take it upon themselves to take payment and reinstate the policy. I have offered to 3 seperate departments to pay the outstanding balance and speak to the bank to ensure the direct debit gets set up properly, but still nobody is able to arrange this.

Terrible terrible service, and it is no wonder that M&S posted a £60m loss on operating profit last year. I for one would not be sad to see the back of this ""British Institution"" who are obviously thinking solely about profits and not giving a secnd thought to their customers.",2014-09-23 09:32:51

457376154351363_681434618612181,"Ladies and gentlemen, for those considering getting it, M&S car insurance:

I sign up for M&S car insurance, I pay my monthly premium like a good customer, I even drive carefully and don't trouble them at all.

Then one day a lady in a rush backs out into my car.

No problem, you might think - I have M&S car insurance. At any rate, the lady in a rush accepts full culpability so this should be repaired in no time. Very straightforward.

Not with M&S car insurance! The first thing that happens is they write off the car for what is a dent. A mighty dent to be sure, but a dent none the less. Okay, I'm not in the insurance business, if that's how they handle it, that's how they handle it. The rest should be straightforward - I should get a cheque soon and that will be that.

More than a month passes, with no information from M&S. We get a different person every time we call up for an update, and each time they give us a different answer. Collectively these lots of little different answers form one big answer: they don't know what's happening with the car. Then, after weeks and weeks of this:

They lose the car.

I mean lose the car - no idea where it is. Still I am getting different people every time I call up. Still I am starting from scratch every time I call. So I give up on them and track the car down myself. Eventually, days and days and many many phone calls and hours on hold later, I find the car…in a breakers yard in Milton Keynes.

I live on the Isle of Wight.

But we've found the car. So the rest should be straightforward, right? It's at that point M&S decide they're not writing off the car after all - they're going to have it repaired. Several more weeks pass as it makes its way back to the Isle of Wight. I can only assume via Kazakstan.

When it gets here, the mechanics at the body repair place that will become its new home in the following weeks, identify a starter motor problem as well - this will need to be replaced, they say. M&S say that on the advice of the mechanics this has nothing to do with the accident, so I will have to pay for it. Fair enough, you might think - so did I - until the mechanic later admits that he only thinks it has nothing to do with the accident. Something M&S car insurance refused to acknowledge. But:

The dent is repaired, the starter motor is replaced. Now, you might think, now things should be pretty straightforward - all we have to do is pick it up! No.

No.

The day I'm due to collect, I inspect my car - the impact area has been repaired nicely, but I discover the car, in it's journey around the UK as a written-off vehicle, has acquired a litany of dents and scratches, as if it were thrown rather than driven home. It's in an appalling state. Well, you might think, that should be pretty straightforward - M&S will have to redo the rest of the body work as well.

It's only now the repair man tells me there is also another problem near the exhaust - on the day we're supposed to collect it. He insists this has nothing to do with the accident until we point out that the point of impact and this new problem are in the same place. Oh yeah, he says, the fact dawning on him slowly. When we remind M&S to pay for this to be repaired as well they threaten us with the bill for it, as well as the bill for the curtesy car while it's being repaired. This has yet to be resolved. It is ongoing as we speak, almost 3 months after the lady in a rush hit our car.

I've spent a significant amount of time chasing this and now know that my car will be recovered tomorrow morning. I accept this though remain completely unimpressed. I fully believe that had fewer companies,organisations and people been involved from the start the process would have been a lot smoother.

I was advised to take out a M&S credit card to ensure the best rates on future purchases - which my wife and I did. For £49.22 I got 70 Swiss Francs. We didn't make it as far as Switzerland so yesterday I returned to Bluewater and sold them back for £41.43. A spread of £7.79 or nearly 16% - basically I was skinned. When I protested, the sales assistant just held her hands up in a ""nothing to do with me"" gesture.
I had a similar experience when I was cold-sold gas and electricity in-store. I was assured that M&S Energy made sure that their customers got the best possible deal on the market. However, it turned out to be backed by SSE who were subsequently fined for ripping-off customers. When I (finally) got through to someone at M&S Energy, they couldn't care less that they had directed their customers to what turned out to be little more than a confidence trick. The CEO of M&S wouldn't take my call but a spokesperson told me that they stood by their association with SSE.

So very, very disappointed with M&S. Have been a customer since 1947 when my mum bought my clothes there. I have had a M&S Chargecard since they were first introduced. I moved to the USA in 2003 and have been purchasing online. Just received my new cards, to be activated in the store,! As I am not coming home for a holiday anytime soon, M&S won't let me use them or activate them for me on the telephone. I have just phoned from USA, been on the telephone for almost 30 minutes (goodness knows what my telephone bill will be) being passed from one to another. The final decision is that no, they won't do anything for me to activate the card. This is not a credit card it is a Chargecard so can't see what the problem is.

Once a window is smashed whether in a home or car it is no longer secure so you seem to have covered yourselves and probably don't have to pay out many claims. Well done you.

I was looking to close my credit card that I have with yourselves, as there was only a very small balance to pay and have no use for this card anymore. I spoke to a very unhelpful member of your customer services team in Manila who proceeded to tell me that my account wouldn't close until a nil balance statement had been received at the end of the month. As I am currently looking to obtain credit from elsewhere (in the form of a loan) I am looking to get this account closed ASAP, as obviously when I apply for this loan, the loan provider will see I currently have £4k available credit on this credit card, even though I have paid it off in full and no longer have £4k worth of credit at my disposal. Not only is this extremely inconvenient but I was astounded at the unprofessional customer service I received from the first lady I spoke too. This included calling me Mrs Haynes, Using the wrong name, trying to give the impression that she would achieve what I was asking, by saying it in a different manner (her English was not so great) and using this fact to her advantage. She used words such as 'honouring the payment' which she believed would fool me into thinking that meant closing the account today. Very clever. When I asked to speak to a supervisor she said no one was available to take my call and then that the supervisor doesn't actually take calls. She then said that she would take my number and call me back, which I was not going to accept and so I sat in a queue (a total of 35 minutes) in order for a supervisor (who apparently doesn't take calls) to answer my call.

Your latest M&S credit card statements carry what purports to be advice of a revision to your own bank details and a suggestion that customers might need to take action with their own banks to revise their direct debits. I think this situation and the likely need for urgent action, is inadequately explained in the text of the message. I believe it will cause confusion and resentment among customers who might not realise that unless they quickly initiate an inspection & revision to their existing rolling dd instructions, they may well fall foul of late payment penalties imposed by you.

I joined last year mainly for the family travel insurance, though the vouchers and treats are definitely a bonus!

This summer, I took my three small children (5,7,8) back to my home country, Canada. Trying to do it on the cheap as much as possible (I am a single mum on a budget!), I flew us direct Glasgow to Toronto, intending to stay in a youth hostel for a couple of days sightseeing before taking the train to my home city, Montreal. 

Alas, on the second day, my daughter, Molly, 8, took ill. After a night of her groaning and clutching her tummy, I took her and my two jetlagged boys on a sunrise taxi ride to Toronto Sick Kids Hospital. To make a long story short, one emergency laparoscopic appendectomy, overnight hospital stay, over night hotel stay, juggling one sick child with two hyper boys, missed train and last minute plane flight later......we made it to Montreal and my mother's house. 

Due to her excellent care at Toronto Sick Kids, Molly was leaping into a crystal clear Quebec lake one week later, none the worse for wear and our holiday practically uninterrupted.

But I want to thank M&S insurance for taking care of the hospital bill ($12000 US!) and my out of pocket expenses (hotel, flights, etc), saving me from credit card debt I simply cannot afford. I am ever so grateful for your speed, efficiency and compassion.

Your call centre line manager is going to call him at home and apologise for a wasted afternoon... This was 46 minutes ago and still no call from M&S Bank..?

Social media is a good way of letting the world know exactly how good your customer service really is... And so far it stinks! 

I will keep complaining till my Step-Father gets his help...",2013-09-27 12:22:18

Wait 3 weeks. Get another letter from M&S saying they tried to take money from your account. Phone M&S. After 15 minute phone call, be told that it's Bank of Scotland blocking the DD. Phone Bank of Scotland. Be told that's utter rubbish, and that all they received from M&S was my NAME. Phone M&S. Have another 10 minute conversation. Have to fill in ANOTHER DD mandate. Wait 3 weeks. Receive voice mail from M&S saying everything is fine. Wait 1 week. Receive voice mail from the Collections Dept at M&S asking you to contact them as soon as possible.. Have another 15 minute phone call with them. Be told that they're having problems setting up renewed DDs. I've now had to set up a standing order with M&S Bank.. How on Earth can this be?!
